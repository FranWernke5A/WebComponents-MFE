# POC of React WebComponents in MicroFront-Ends

This repository contains a small project of an App that uses WebComponents and React. It is intended to be a POC that demonstrates the capabilities of client-side composition as a MicroFrontend building pattern.

This project was based on the video [Web Components for Micro Frontends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUtCnA9WEgQ) on YouTube.
